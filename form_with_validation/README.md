# Form with Validation
A simple form that includes custom validation.

The app mainly includes:
- Three `TextFormField` wigets, each with their controller.
- A validator for each one of the fields.
- An `InkWell` button with custom decorations. 
- An `autovalidateMode` that will be enabled when the button is first clicked.
- A `SnackBar` that will show when the form is valid.

**Note:** The `autovalidateMode` is used to let the user know in **real-time** that the form has become valid, instead of having to click the button each time to check the validity.
